* What is this?

with-fake-head is a script to run commands under a fake X display.
Some programs need to be operated under an X session (sometimes even
with a real display attached) using a particular gpu. For example,
nvidia-settings can only work on the gpu of its X session. For gpgpu
computing, in headless servers or when the real X is running on
another gpu (the preferred setup) this makes changing or querying
settings awkward.

* Examples

Query all nvidia settings for two cards:

: with-fake-head -p 00:02:0,01:00.0 -- nvidia-settings -q all

Enable double precision mode on a GTX Titan:

: with-fake-head -r NVIDIA -- nvidia-settings \
:      -a [gpu:0]/GPUDoublePrecisionBoostImmediate=1

Run xterm and display it in the normal X display:

: with-fake-head -r NVIDIA -- env DISPLAY=:0.0 xterm
